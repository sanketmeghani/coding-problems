# Mirrored Binary Tree

Write a program to check if the given binary tree is mirrored or not.

A tree is said to be mirrored if the left sub tree and the right subtree of the root node are mirror image of each other.

For example, following trees are mirrored trees:

```
     0            0              0
    / \         /   \          /   \
   1   1       1     1        1     1
              / \   / \        \   /
             2   3 3   2        3 3
```
