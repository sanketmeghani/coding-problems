[Reverse Polish notation (RPN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation), also known as Polish postfix notation or simply postfix notation, is a mathematical notation in which operators follow their operands, in contrast to Polish notation (PN), in which operators precede their operands.

Infix expression `(8 * 7) - 6` is written in RPN as `8 7 * 6 -`.
