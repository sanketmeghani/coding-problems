# Rotated Array

Given a sorted array which was rotated a few times. Write a programme to identify how many times the array was rotated and the direction of rotation.

Explanation for array rotation:

* Given sorted array: `[1, 4, 7, 9, 15, 23, 50, 100]`
* Original array after 1 rotation: `[4, 7, 9, 15, 23, 50, 100, 1]`
* Original array after 2 rotations: `[7, 9, 15, 23, 50, 100, 1, 4]`

Example input & output:

Given an input array `[9, 15, 23, 50, 100, 1, 4, 7]`, your programme should output:

Your function should return 4.
