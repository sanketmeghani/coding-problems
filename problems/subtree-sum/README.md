# Sum of Subtree

Given a binary tree and a given number n, write a programme to print root node of all sub-trees whose sum is equal to given number n.

Consider following binary tree:

```
          3
        /   \
      4       0
    /   \       \
  1       2       7
```

For n = 7, the programme should print 4, 0, 7 as the subtrees starting at node 4 (4 + 1 + 2), 0 (0 + 7) and 7 (7) adds up to 7.
